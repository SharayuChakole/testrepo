It was designed by Edwin Lutyens in 1921, in the memory of the Indian soldiers who died during the World War I.\\n\\nIndia Gate is 42 meters high and a radius of 625 meters. It is a famous tourist destination. At the bottom of India Gate, there is another monument known as Amar Jawan Jyoti.  Amar Jawan Jyoti was constructed after independence. It is customary for the President and the Prime Minister of the country to pay homage at India Gate during state ceremonies.\\n\\nThe view around India Gate is beautiful, and one can see Rashtrapati Bhawan standing majestically in the vicinity of the India Gate. On the Republic day every year, a parade is conducted by the Indian army, navy, and soldiers of India at the India Gate. During the parade, one can appreciate the diverse cultural heritage of India, as many people from all over the country participate in it. Latest advancement of defense technology is displayed on this occasion, and many people are awarded for their bravery towards the nation.'"
